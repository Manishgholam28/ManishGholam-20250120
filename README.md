##Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer service interaction data to identify patterns and trends that can help improve the quality of interactions, reduce their frequency, and ultimately lower operational costs. The insights generated through this analysis are intended to be shared with various departments to optimize customer service operations and enhance the overall customer experience.

##Objectives
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct foundational descriptive statistics to understand the data.
Calculate the average number of customer contacts per order.
Analyze the distribution of customer contacts (e.g., percentage of orders with 1, 2, or more contacts).
Visualize key metrics to illustrate findings.

2. Pattern Identification:
Dive deeper into the data to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.
Identify factors contributing to frequent customer service interactions.

3. Actionable Insights:
Translate findings into concrete recommendations for optimizing customer service.
Suggest strategies to enhance the quality of interactions and reduce repetitive customer inquiries.

##Approach
1. Data Exploration:
Analyze key columns like errand_category, errand_type, errand_action, and errand_channel.
Compute descriptive statistics and visualize distributions to understand customer interaction trends.

2. Visualization:
Use bar charts, pie charts, and other visual tools to illustrate data patterns.
Highlight top categories contributing to frequent interactions.

##Tools and Technologies
Python: For data analysis and visualization.
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, Numpy.
Visualization Tools: Bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps.
Data Management: Pandas for exploratory data analysis and manipulation.
